    "## Insights & Key Findings\n",
    "1. Pricing Patterns\n",
    "    - Airbnb prices in San Francisco are highly skewed, with most listings clustered below $300 and a small number of luxury listings driving the long tail.\n",
    "    - Entire homes/apartments consistently command the highest prices on average, while private rooms are significantly more affordable.\n",
    "    - When controlling for room type, neighborhoods such as Western Addition, Bernal Heights, Cole Valley, and Alamo Square show noticeably higher median prices.\n",
    "    - Listings with more capacity tend to cost more, but price per person often decreases as accommodates increases, suggesting economies of scale for larger groups.\n",
    "2. Neighborhood Differences\n",
    "    - Neighborhoods with the largest number of listings showed meaningful price variation.\n",
    "    - Some areas (e.g., Western Addition and Bernal Heights) combine high prices with strong review scores, indicating both demand and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "    - More central or tourist-friendly neighborhoods exhibit higher prices even when ratings are similar to less central ones.\n",
    "3. Host Behavior & Experience\n",
    "    - Superhosts tend to charge slightly higher prices, though the difference narrows when adjusting for room type and location.\n",
    "    - Hosts with longer tenure (years since joining Airbnb) often have more optimized pricing. However, there is no strong linear relationship between host tenure and higher guest ratings.\n",
    "    - Response and acceptance rates were generally high across the dataset, suggesting competitive host behavior.\n",
    "4. Review Scores & Listing Quality\n",
    "    - Ratings are heavily concentrated between 4.5 and 5.0, which is typical for Airbnb.\n",
    "    - There is no strong direct correlation between rating and price, but higher-priced listings show slightly higher consistency in rating quality.\n",
    "    - Listings with more reviews tend to be priced closer to the neighborhood median, suggesting that demand helps stabilize pricing over time.\n",
    "5. Amenities & Perceived Value\n",
    "    - The number of amenities varies widely, from very minimal offerings to extensive lists.\n",
    "    - Listings with more amenities generally show higher prices, though the relationship is not perfectly linear.\n",
    "    - Amenities appear to contribute more to price differentiation within room types, rather than across them."

    "## Overall Takeaways\n",
    "- Location, room type, and accommodation size are the strongest drivers of price in San Francisco’s Airbnb market.\n",
    "- Host status and experience influence pricing, but not as strongly as structural listing features.\n",
    "- Reviews and ratings show limited impact on price, reinforcing the idea that guests often prioritize location and property type over marginal differences in rating.\n",
    "- Amenity count provides additional price lift, especially among mid-range listings competing for visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the analysis shows that structural listing features (especially room type, neighborhood, and amenities) are the strongest price drivers in San Francisco’s Airbnb market."
